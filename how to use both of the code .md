To use both of the code together, you can start by copying the first code block and pasting it into your Python file. 
Then, you can copy the second code block and paste it below the first code block in the same file.

You will then need to make sure that any variables or functions that are defined in the first code block are not redefined in the second code block. 
For example, the "open_file" and "save_file" functions are defined in both code blocks, so you will need to remove the duplicate definitions in the second code block.

Once you have made these adjustments, you should be able to run the file and use the notepad 
application with all of the additional features, such as cut, copy, paste, font, background color, undo, and redo.

It's important to note that if you want to use the "set_font" and "set_background_color" functions you need to import font module from tkinter library, 
if it's not already imported.

Also, you might want to test and debug your code after combining the two code block, to make sure that everything is working as expected.
